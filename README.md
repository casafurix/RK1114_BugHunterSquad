Stable isotope data can contribute to a better understanding of groundwater recharge process,
estimation of evaporative effects, characterization of the catchment area, surface water groundwater
connection and groundwater mixing properties which are crucial for improved groundwater
management. Over a period of more than four decades, a large number of isotopic measurements on
groundwater have been made in different parts of the country in connection with several local
investigations. Centralized data repositories have become increasingly important as a means for
archiving information and analytics of the resources. However, to date a centralized database for the
management of groundwater isotope data doesn't exist.

● A web interface and an associated App may be designed which provides a comprehensive
compilation of stable isotope groundwater data. Key information stored may include hydrogen and
oxygen isotope ratio, water type, collection date and time, site location, project information etc. Data
Source: Information on stable isotope groundwater data will be provided by CGWB and other
research organizations.

● Expected Outcome: A web based searchable database on Isotope data. Collection of stable isotope
data from public domain. Development of Visualization tools. Innovative approach may be attempted
to: Create maps and graphs which can be used for the interpretation of the stable isotope values of
groundwater.
